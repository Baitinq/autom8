Let me verify all the verification criteria are met:

1. **chat command accepts a worktree name argument** ✅ - `Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1)` ensures exactly one argument
2. **chat command validates worktree exists (like inspect does)** ✅ - Same pattern as inspect: `if _, err := os.Stat(worktreePath); os.IsNotExist(err)`
3. **chat command extracts task ID from worktree name and loads task details** ✅ - Extracts task ID using `strings.LastIndex` and loads from `tasks.json`
4. **chat command gathers git log since branching from main** ✅ - `git log --oneline main..HEAD`
5. **chat command gathers diff from main (git diff main...HEAD)** ✅ - `git diff main...HEAD`
6. **chat command builds a system prompt with task context** ✅ - `buildChatSystemPrompt()` includes task, criteria, commits, and diff
7. **chat command launches interactive claude with --system-prompt in the worktree directory** ✅ - `exec.Command("claude", "--system-prompt", systemPrompt)` with `Dir = worktreePath`
8. **chat command displays worktree info before starting (similar to inspect)** ✅ - Displays title, worktree, branch, task ID, task summary, and progress
9. **chat command is registered in init() and added to rootCmd** ✅ - `rootCmd.AddCommand(chatCmd)` in init()

All verification criteria are satisfied.
