Let me verify all verification criteria are met:

1. ✅ **chat command accepts a worktree name argument** - `Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1)` ensures this
2. ✅ **chat command validates worktree exists (like inspect does)** - Uses `os.Stat` to check existence, returns error if not found
3. ✅ **chat command extracts task ID from worktree name and loads task details** - Uses `strings.LastIndex` to extract task ID, loads from `loadTasks()`
4. ✅ **chat command gathers git log since branching from main** - Uses `git log --oneline main..HEAD`
5. ✅ **chat command gathers diff from main (git diff main...HEAD)** - Uses `git diff main...HEAD`
6. ✅ **chat command builds a system prompt with task context** - `buildChatSystemPrompt` function creates comprehensive context
7. ✅ **chat command launches interactive claude with --system-prompt in the worktree directory** - Uses `exec.Command("claude", "--system-prompt", systemPrompt)` with `Dir` set to worktreePath
8. ✅ **chat command displays worktree info before starting (similar to inspect)** - Shows worktree name, branch, path, task ID, and truncated prompt
9. ✅ **chat command is registered in init() and added to rootCmd** - `rootCmd.AddCommand(chatCmd)` in init()

All criteria are satisfied.

TASK COMPLETE
